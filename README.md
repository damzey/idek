# Hangman Project

In this project, my aim was to create a simple Hangman game, which is an interactive real world game. Using Object Orientated Programming, I created a Hangman class with all the necessary methods to make my script run smoothly. In my Hangman game, the computer randomly chooses a word from the list of words provided, which is denoted as blank underscores ('_ _ _ _ _ _') which vary depending on the length of the mystery word.  The user has to guess valid characters that are in that word. If you guess correctly, the character will replace the respective blank in the word, but if the users guess is incorrect, they will lose a life. The game will end if the user loses all 3 lives, or if the user correctly guesses the word. 

A snippet of the outcome:
